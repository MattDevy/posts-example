# posts-example

Example backend for basic posting app

Has / will have endpoints:
- Create Post 
- Get Post
- List Posts (with pagination)
- Update Post
- Delete Post


## TODO
- proper pagination - probably timestamp of first request, offset, all the query parameters? If we put all this stuff in, token needs to be secure / encrypted
